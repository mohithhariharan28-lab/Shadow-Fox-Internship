Delhi Air Quality (AQI) Analysis

Beginner Level Project

Overview

This project analyzes Delhi’s air quality using Python to understand pollution trends, key pollutants, and seasonal variations. PM2.5 is used as an AQI proxy for analysis.

Objectives

Study air pollution trends

Identify major pollutants

Analyze seasonal and monthly patterns

Practice data visualization

Dataset

delhiaqi.csv containing date-wise pollutant data (PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO₂, SO₂, O₃, NH₃).

Tools Used

Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Analysis Performed

PM2.5 trend analysis

Pollutant comparison

Correlation analysis

Seasonal & monthly variation

PM2.5 vs PM10 comparison

Key Insights

PM2.5 and PM10 are dominant pollutants

Winter and post-monsoon show highest pollution

Monsoon season improves air quality

How to Run
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
python shadow_fox.py
